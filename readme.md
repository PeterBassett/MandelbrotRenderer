# Mandelbrot Renderer

A bit of fun generating pretty images of the mandelbrot set.

* \+ & - to zoom in and out
* wasd to move around
* e to change the method used to calculate the colour of each pixel. There are several available, higher quality & slower or faster & lower quality.
* p to change the colour palette in use
* r to rotate the current colour palette
* < & > increase and decrease the maximum number of iterations in used in the escape functions. 
This dictates detail at deeper zoom levels.
* i to show/hide information about the rendering
